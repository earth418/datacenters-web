        <p id="s1p1">The city of Tuscon, AZ has been, for the last several months, in battle with the 
            interests of these private corporations about a proposed data center within their
            city limits.</p>
        <p id="s1p2">This is Project Blue -- a 290 acre powerful data center campus, 
            being built by a company called Beale Infrastructure, a datacenter building subsidary of asset manager Blue
            Owl and reportedly tied to Amazon. The campus has at least three data centers and currently has a 286MW energy agreement, but with rumors that the final number of 
            buildings
            <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-named-as-company-behind-290-acre-data-center-campus-in-tuscson-arizona/">
            could go up to ten</a>, with 600 MW of data center power. And this is one of two data centers Beale is planning to build in this county. </p>
        <p id="s1p3">Hundreds of city residents protested and voted against
            the construction of the data center, citing environmental, water use, and energy concerns, and 
            the city of Tuscon blocked water access for the project.
            But the company is building the data center anyway, <b style="color:#003">right outside</b> city limits.
        </p>
        <p id="s1p4">
            Outside of the city and residents' jurisdiction and water availability, but well within range

        <p id="s2p1">In Memphis, TN, Elon Musk's xAI has built an enormous data center --
            one of the biggest in the world. xAI has dubbed it the "world's largest supercomputer," running over 230,000 NVidia GPUs.</p>
        <p id="s2p2">The data center of course, has an enormous energy footprint -- 
            and, to power the site, xAI built 35 small-scale methane gas turbines. The resulting air pollutants 
            and carbon emissions have come to effect the nearby predominantly-black community of Boxton, which 
            already has the highest levels of Athsma in the state, and its air pollution and cancer risks are 
            significantly higher than average due to pollution from companies previously present in the area. 
        </p>
        <!-- https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/musk-xai-colossus-supercomputer-boxtown-memphis-tennessee-rcna206242 -->
        <p id="s2p3">
            Musk says this is just the start for this AI data center, dubbed "Colossus." The billionaire promises this will
            transform the region into a tech hub, already having purchased a nearby property and expanding talks with the 
            municipality to install his turbines permanently.
        </p>
        <p id="s2p4">
            <!-- style="font-size:1em;"> -->
            The EPA has been unable to investigate, and the mayor of Memphis allows
            Musk to continue -- without any permits -- because he's promised the turbines are temporary.
            However, 
            "Researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, based on public satellite 
            data from NASA and the European Space Agency, found that 
            average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have increased by 3% when comparing the 
            periods before June 2024 and afterward. They also found that peak NO2 levels have 
            increased by 79% from pre-xAI levels in areas immediately 
            surrounding the data center, and by 9% in nearby Boxtown." NO2 is a pollutant emitted
            from many combustion reactions and causes respiratory problems after inhalation, and leads to
            increased rates of athsma in children -- and because of xAI's data center, 
            it will enter the lungs of Boxtown residents.

        <p id="s3p1">Right across from the Mississippi from xAI's Colossus, in West Memphis, AR, Google has
            planned one of their flagship enormous data centers.</p>
        <p id="s3p2">
            Contrary to the majority of these data centers and likely to avoid the controversey 
            and public outcry they've faced, Google has promised that alongside their data center
            they will be building a 650 MW solar plant and 350 MW of power storage, as well as
            paying for all electricity the data center will use. In addition, they've started a 
            $25 million fund to help with energy costs in the area.
        </p>
        <!-- https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/musk-xai-colossus-supercomputer-boxtown-memphis-tennessee-rcna206242 -->
        <p id="s3p3">
            But this is Google's flagship data center, and will cost $4BN to build its first phase -- 
            making that $25 million only 0.25% of the data center's total cost.
            And are Google's promises her even enough? After all, 
            this data center -- while its full scope is unknown -- will
            use many multiples of the 650 MW of energy Google plans to add to the grid. 
            How will that gap be filled? Unfortunately, 
            almost certainly by burning natural gas,
            especially given the current administration.
        </p>
        <p id="s3p4">
            Adding one AI data center to a grid rivals adding millions 
            of homes, and the regional power utility will increase capacity to compensate.
            But if this data center is eventually no longer needed, or Google changes course,
            the area's residents are left with expensive, overbuilt power generation infrastructure
            that they now must pay for.

            Up north, Amazon recently opened their massive AI data center in New Charlisle, Indiana --

        <p id="s4p2">
            By making deals directly with the electricity utility of the town, Amazon
            is bypassing any munincipal control over what will very likely end up using
            a significant amount of energy and leading to increased energy use and cost.

        <p id="s4p3">
            Especially since this enormous project in the 2,000 person lakeside town uses as much
            electricity as 1.5 million homes, over half the energy used by the homes of the state 
            of Indiana -- more than the top 50 most populated cities in the state combed.
        </p>
        <p id="s4p4">
            A Bloomberg investigation revealed that data centers have led to disproportionately 
            large increases in energy costs for homes around the country, especially those
            located in towns containing data centers. In the last five years, energy costs have 
            risen by as much as 267%, while residential energy demand has stagnated or even fell.
            In a world trending towards efficiency and getting more out of less energy use,
            data centers are causing the US to increase our energy use more than ever.
