        <p id="s1p1">The city of Tuscon, AZ has been, for the last several months, in battle with the 
            interests of these private corporations about a proposed data center within their
            city limits.</p>
        <p id="s1p2">This is Project Blue -- a 290 acre powerful data center campus, 
            being built by a company called Beale Infrastructure, a datacenter building subsidary of asset manager Blue
            Owl and reportedly tied to Amazon. The campus has at least three data centers and currently has a 286MW energy agreement, but with rumors that the final number of 
            buildings
            <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-named-as-company-behind-290-acre-data-center-campus-in-tuscson-arizona/">
            could go up to ten</a>, with 600 MW of data center power. And this is one of two data centers Beale is planning to build in this county. </p>
        <p id="s1p3">Hundreds of city residents protested and voted against
            the construction of the data center, citing environmental, water use, and energy concerns, and 
            the city of Tuscon blocked water access for the project.
            But the company is building the data center anyway, <b style="color:#003">right outside</b> city limits.
        </p>
        <p id="s1p4">
            Outside of the city and residents' jurisdiction and water availability, but well within range 
            to take advantage of the region's energy, and labor resources.

        <p id="s2p1">In Memphis, TN, Elon Musk's xAI has built an enormous data center --
            one of the biggest in the world. xAI has dubbed it the "world's largest supercomputer," running over 230,000 NVidia GPUs.</p>
        <p id="s2p2">The data center of course, has an enormous energy footprint -- 
            and, to power the site, xAI built 35 small-scale methane gas turbines. The resulting air pollutants 
            and carbon emissions have come to effect the nearby predominantly-black community of Boxton.
        </p>

        <p id="s2p3">
            Musk says this is just the start for this AI data center, dubbed "Colossus." The billionaire promises this will
            transform the region into a tech hub, already having purchased a nearby property and expanding talks with the 
            municipality to install his turbines permanently.

            <!-- style="font-size:1em;"> -->
            The county already has the highest levels of Athsma in the state, and its air pollution and cancer risks are 
            significantly higher than average due to pollution from companies previously present in the area. The EPA has been unable to investigate, and the mayor of Memphis allows
            Musk to continue -- without any permits -- because he's promised the turbines are temporary.
            However, 
            "Researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, based on public satellite 
            data from NASA and the European Space Agency, found that 
            average concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have increased by 3% when comparing the 
            periods before June 2024 and afterward. They also found that peak NO2 levels have 
            increased by 79% from pre-xAI levels in areas immediately 
            surrounding the data center, and by 9% in nearby Boxtown."
